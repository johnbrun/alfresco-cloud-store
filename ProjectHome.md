# Alfresco Cloud Store #

This project aims to develop implementations of Alfresco's "Content Store" API aimed at supporting different cloud-storage platforms such as:

  * Amazon S3
  * EMC Atmos
  * Nirvanix
  * Iron Mountain
  * Others

The initial implementation is for Amazon S3 and uses the jets3t Java library. But future implementations may make use of universal libraries such as [CloudLoop](http://www.cloudloop.com).
